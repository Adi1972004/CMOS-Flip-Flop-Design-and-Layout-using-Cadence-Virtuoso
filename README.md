# CMOS Flip-Flop Design and Layout using Cadence Virtuoso

This repository presents the design, layout, and simulation of **edge-triggered flip-flops** using **CMOS transmission gates** in **Cadence Virtuoso**.  
The project focuses on implementing, analyzing, and comparing master-slave and dynamic flip-flops with and without two-phase clock generators.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Designed **Master-Slave Negative Edge Triggered Flip-Flop** using a 2x1 MUX (built with transmission gates).  
- Designed **Dynamic Positive Edge Triggered Flip-Flop** using transmission gates.  
- Implemented both flip-flops **with and without two-phase clock generators**.  
- Performed **layout design**, **RC extraction**, and **post-layout simulations** in **Cadence Virtuoso** to evaluate timing performance.
